          Design is always around us, and learning how to communicate in a visual manner has inspired me to learn more
          about the subject. The concept of ‘create’ and ‘design’ have always sparked a sense of enthusiasm and
          excitement within me. I am driven to learn more about and its vast spectrum knowledge as well as the user
          psychology &amp; principles of design to strive, to become the best designer I can be.

                I’m an 18 years old aspiring UX designer, currently developing my skills through freelance jobs and
                higher education. <br />I’m skilled in using design apps such as Figma and AdobeXD. <br /><br />While
                being an UX designer, I am also passionate in filming and video editing in which I use my free time
                editing videos through Davinci Resolve 18, in which I’m quite proficient in.<br /><br />‘m friendly and
                honest individual that believes keeping active is important. I do this with my hobbies such as sports
                like football and cycling. From playing team sports throughout my life I have learnt how to be effective
                in a team which helped me during my school life and will in the future to fit well into team
                environment.<br /><br />I took upon UXD course in the Netherlands as I believe it is the first step
                towards learning about different aspects and cultural boundaries. It is very interesting to study how
                people from different parts of the world think and to how we should design for them. These factors are
                what motivate me to strive to become a relatable, smart, and successful designer. I will strive to share
                my design style of minimalistic, intricate, and effect focused style as much as possible while also
                satisfying people who come across it.

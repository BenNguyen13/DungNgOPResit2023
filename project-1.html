            SIMControl is a web-based SIM management solution. It offers Business Prepaid, APN as well as Global Roaming
            options on various African and international mobile networks. <br /><br />Recently, to expand further to the
            European market, I was tasked to create full functioning prototypes of their website as well as the RICA
            process required to register every SIM<br /><br />I am highly skilled in using the software FIGMA, as
            demonstrated in my final prototype designs.

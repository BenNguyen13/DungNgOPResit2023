            Red packets, also known as &#34;hongbao&#34; or &#34;lai see,&#34; are traditional gifts that are given
            during the Chinese New Year to bring good luck and prosperity.<br /><br />To design my red packets, I used
            bright and vibrant colors to convey the joy and excitement of the Chinese New Year. I also incorporated
            traditional Chinese symbols and patterns, such as red lanterns, gold coins, and the Chinese character for
            &#34;good fortune.&#34;<br /><br />Overall, I am proud of my red packet designs and I hope that they bring a
            bit of joy and cheer to people during this challenging time.
